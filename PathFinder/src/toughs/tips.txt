algorithm for wildcard:

1. initialise the 1st row and col element as true

2. now for every dp[0][j] (first row) mark as false, as empty string does not match

3. for every dp[i][0] (first col) if the previous is star , mark as true , else mark as false

4. start the bottom up approach
     a. if char matches or equals to ? ->  dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
      b. if char is *  then -->  dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i][j - 1];
       c. else:   mark as false -> dp[i][j] = false;

chocolate wrappers algorithms

Find initial number of chocolates by
dividing the amount with per piece cost.
i.e. choc = money / price

then apply below formula
choc += (choc - 1)/(wrap - 1)
